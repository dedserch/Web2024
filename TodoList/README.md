# TodoList React TypeScript 📝

Welcome to the **TodoList** project! This application is the first lab work for the Web Programming 2024 course at Belarusian State University. It helps you manage your tasks effectively while adhering to specific requirements. Let's dive into the details! 🌟

## Project Overview

This TodoList is built using React and TypeScript, focusing on a clean and user-friendly interface. The main goal is to create a simple, yet powerful task manager that allows users to add, complete, and filter tasks.

## Features 🌈

- **Task Creation**: 
  - An input field for task title and description.
  - A button to add new tasks.
  
- **Task Management**: 
  - Each task has a checkbox to mark it as completed or not. ✅
  - Tasks can be deleted with a hover action. ❌
  - Completed tasks are displayed after incomplete ones.

- **Filtering**: 
  - A filter option to show only incomplete tasks.

## Requirements 📋

1. **Functional Components**: 
   - No functional components are allowed; use class components only.

2. **Task Display**: 
   - Task representation is handled in a separate component.

3. **Task Name Validation**:
   - Task names cannot be empty.
   - Task names cannot start or end with whitespace.

4. **Timestamp**: 
   - Each task displays the time it was created.

5. **Hover to Delete**: 
   - The delete option appears when hovering over a task.

6. **Code Quality**:
   - Consistent styling throughout the application (see General > Styleguide).
   - Meaningful and concise names for classes, functions, and variables.
   - No unnecessary comments, files, or unused code.
